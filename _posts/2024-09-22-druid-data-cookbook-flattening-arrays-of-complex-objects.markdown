A common problem in data that we ingest into Druid is that we may encounter arrays of nested objects, and we want to reason about specific fields within those objects. For instance, assume we have various teams for some sort of contest, and the members of a team might be represented like so:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Alice",
    "gender": "F"
  },
  {
    "name": "Bob",
    "gender": "M"
  },
  {
    "name": "Carol",
    "gender": "F"
  }
]
```

Each member has a name and some other attributes. But what if I want to get a list of all the teams that Bob is a member of? I'd need to extract an array of the relevant subfields only. How do I do this in Druid?

The na√Øve approach would be to write some expression like `JSON_VALUE("members", '$[*].name')`. Unfortunately, Druid does not support wildcard syntax in JSONPath expressions. So if seems that we are stuck. Or are we?

## Loading some data

For this tutorial, download a fresh copy of [Druid 30](https://druid.apache.org/downloads/). Run a local [quickstart](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/) instance and ingest this data set:

```
timestamp|team|members
2024-09-01|Team 1|[{ "name": "Alice", "gender": "F" }, { "name": "Bob", "gender": "M" }, { "name": "Carol", "gender": "F" }]
2024-09-01|Team 2|[{ "name": "Dan", "gender": "M" }, { "name": "Eve", "gender": "F" }, { "name": "Frank", "gender": "M" }]
```

If you use the SQL wizard, choose the TSV parser and set the separator character to `|`. Also, make sure that you add the `PARSE_JSON` function to the expression for the `members` column:

Or just use this SQL:

```sql
REPLACE INTO "teams_data" OVERWRITE ALL
WITH "ext" AS (
  SELECT *
  FROM TABLE(
    EXTERN(
      '{"type":"inline","data":"timestamp|team|members\n2024-09-01|Team 1|[{ \"name\": \"Alice\", \"gender\": \"F\" }, { \"name\": \"Bob\", \"gender\": \"M\" }, { \"name\": \"Carol\", \"gender\": \"F\" }]\n2024-09-01|Team 2|[{ \"name\": \"Dan\", \"gender\": \"M\" }, { \"name\": \"Eve\", \"gender\": \"F\" }, { \"name\": \"Frank\", \"gender\": \"M\" }]"}',
      '{"type":"tsv","delimiter":"|","findColumnsFromHeader":true}'
    )
  ) EXTEND ("timestamp" VARCHAR, "team" VARCHAR, "members" VARCHAR)
)
SELECT
  TIME_PARSE(TRIM("timestamp")) AS "__time",
  "team",
  PARSE_JSON("members") AS "members"
FROM "ext"
PARTITIONED BY DAY
```

## Querying the data

Let's first unnest the `members` data into individual rows. Unfortunately, we cannot just apply `UNNEST("members")`. This is because Druid has no way of knowing that the value of `members` is always an array. In [an earlier post](/2023/12/17/druid-29-preview-handling-nested-arrays/) I described the problem and how to solve it using `JSON_QUERY_ARRAY`:

```sql
SELECT
  t."__time",
  t."team",
  r."member_rec"
FROM "teams_data" t CROSS JOIN UNNEST(JSON_QUERY_ARRAY("members", '$')) AS r(member_rec)
```

![Unnest query](/assets/2024-09-22-02-unnest.png)

Use this query as a common table expression and group the values back in the main query:

```sql
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT
    t."__time",
    t."team",
    r."member_rec"
  FROM "teams_data" t CROSS JOIN UNNEST(JSON_QUERY_ARRAY("members", '$')) AS r(member_rec)
)
SELECT team, ARRAY_AGG(JSON_VALUE(member_rec, '$.name')) AS member_names
FROM cte
GROUP BY team
```

![Full query](/assets/2024-09-22-03-query.png)

As you can see, this query yields a list of _member names_ for each team - just what we wanted to get.

This technique is even more powerful when used in conjunction with `JSON_PATHS` to extract leaf objects at any level of the hierarchy. But I will leave that for another blog post.

## Conclusion

- In order to flatten and extract scalar fields from arrays of complex objects, you can transpose them using the `UNNEST` function.
- Advanced filtering can be done on the single row level.
- Then group the values back together and use `ARRAY_AGG` to reconstitute the arrays.
