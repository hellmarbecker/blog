Today, I am going to look at geospatial data in Apache Druid in some more detail. [Back in September](/2021/09/05/geospatial-data-in-apache-druid-ingestion/), we learned how to ingest these data into Druid.

It turns out that a spatial dimension is in fact not much more than a string, in which x and y coordinate (or latitude and longitude) are separated by a comma. (You could also have more than two dimensions, but the filtering semantics are tailored for two dimensions.)

## Data Generation

First, we need to generate some test data. I am using the [Faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html) module in a small script like this:

```python
import json
from faker import Faker

fake = Faker()

def main():

    print("latitude,longitude,place_name,country_code,timezone")

    for i in range(0, 10000):
        place = fake.location_on_land()
        print(','.join(place))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Ingest these data into Druid as described in [my previous post](/2021/09/05/geospatial-data-in-apache-druid-ingestion/).

## Querying

Let's start with a simple SQL query. I want a list of places with their coordinates, and how often they ocurred in my file:

```sql
SELECT
  coordinates,
  place_name,
  COUNT(*)
FROM 
  geo_data_ww
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

In order to do my spatial magic, I need to convert this SQL code to a Druid native query. This is an easy interactive process in the Druid query console.

First, use the `Explain` function to show the Druid native query that is generated:

Then, use the `Open Query` button to open the native query in the editor, instead of the SQL

## Spatial Filtering!

Now, let's introduce a filter! I am going to try and select only the places within a rectangle that roughly contains my home country, Germany. So I want to cover an area from 47째N to 55째N latitude, and from 6째E to 15째E longitude.

Find the place in the query where it says `"filter": null,` and replace it by the following snippet:
```json
  "filter": {
    "type": "spatial",
    "dimension": "coordinates",
    "bound": {
        "type": "rectangular",
        "minCoords": [47.0, 6.0],
        "maxCoords": [55.0, 15.0]
    }
  },
```

Note how the places that are listed in the result are almost all in Germany! You can also define circle and polygon filters. Spatial dimensions and filters are documented in [https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/geo.html#spatial-indexing].

## Learnings

- Spatial dimensions are encoded as strings.
- Spatial filters are supported by the Druid native query language only.
- You can use the `Explain` function in the Druid console to convert a SQL query into its Druid native equivalent.
