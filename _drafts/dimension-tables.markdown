- tables that appear in the druid schema but exists mainly in memory
- data is persisted in a format that is similar to segments but that is actually snapshots
- you declare a key column and a timestamp and then the latest values for a key are used
- there's a special type of supervisor called `UPDATE_TASK`
- support in the web console is currently limited
- if you change the supervisor spec you need to go to S3 and delete all snapshot files
